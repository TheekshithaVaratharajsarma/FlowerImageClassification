# FlowerImageClassification
Convultional Neural Networks trained to predict the flower.

This is a flower image classification task where CNNs have been trained to predict the name of the flower when the image of a flower is given.

After the original model, 3 variations have been done by adding dropout layers, increasing depth and tuning hyperparameters. The results of each model are discussed and comparison plots have been drawn.
